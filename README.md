A smart monitoring system using DHT sensor and buzzer is a project that aims to monitor the temperature and humidity levels of a room and alert the user when the levels go beyond a certain threshold. The project can also include a feature for making appointments or setting reminders for certain tasks related to temperature and humidity control.

To implement this project, you will need the following components:

DHT sensor: This is a digital sensor that measures temperature and humidity levels.
Buzzer: This is a small electronic device that can emit a sound when triggered.
Microcontroller board: This is a board that can be programmed to read data from the sensor and control the buzzer.
Display: Optional, but you can add a display to show the temperature and humidity levels.
Here's how the project works:

The DHT sensor measures the temperature and humidity levels of the room.
The microcontroller board reads the data from the sensor and compares it to the threshold values set by the user. If the temperature or humidity levels exceed the threshold, the board triggers the buzzer to emit a sound to alert the user.
The display, if present, shows the current temperature and humidity levels.
The user can also set appointments or reminders related to temperature and humidity control, such as turning on or off an air conditioner, humidifier, or dehumidifier.
To implement the appointment feature, you can use a real-time clock (RTC) module that keeps track of the current date and time. The user can set the date and time for the appointment, and the microcontroller board can check the RTC to trigger the buzzer at the scheduled time.

Overall, this project can be a useful tool for monitoring and controlling the temperature and humidity levels of a room, especially in areas where the climate can be extreme. It can also help save energy and reduce costs by allowing users to adjust their temperature and humidity control devices based on the actual levels in the room.
